                <p class="content-text text1">We are the Mechanical Mustangs 6877 FRC FIRST robotics team from Northpointe Christian High School. Our mission is to learn STEM and life skills while glorifying God in all that we do. FIRST presents a high school level robotics challenge each year. This year, we are Charged Up for an eventful season!</p>

                <p class="content-text text2">FIRST is more than just robots. Our student led team encourages teammates to learn many life-skills throughout the season. We learn communication, writing, business, organization skills, and most importantly working together.<br><br>This season, the FRC challenge involves placing cubes and cones on the “grid”. And balancing on the “charge station” (a wobbly platform).</p>

                <p class="content-text text1">Our team has created a robot that is able to drive across a large field and retrieve cubes from the human player “single substation” in a shovel-like mechanism. We are then able to drive back to our “community” where we are able to score in the middle and low nodes of the grid.</p>
